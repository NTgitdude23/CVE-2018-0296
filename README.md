If the web server is vulnerable, the script will dump in a text file both the content of the current directory as well as `+CSCOE+`.

## Bug Bounty Recon
You can use Shodan, Censys or any other OSINT tools to enumerate vulnerable servers but I will not be disclosing the query to us but you can simply look for `/+CSCOE+/logon.html`
